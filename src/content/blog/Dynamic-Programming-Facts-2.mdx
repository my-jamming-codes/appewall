## Dice Throw Problem

**Problem:**

```html
Given `n` dice each with `m` faces, numbered from `1` to `m`, find the number of ways to get a sum
`X`. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.
```

**Example:**

```html
Input: n = 3, m = 6, X = 8 Output: 21
```

**Explanation:**

```html
The number of ways to get a sum of `8` with `3` dice having `6` faces each are `21`. The following
are the possible outcomes: (2, 3, 3) (3, 2, 3) (3, 3, 2) (2, 2, 4) (2, 4, 2) (4, 2, 2) (1, 3, 4) (1,
4, 3) (3, 1, 4) (3, 4, 1) (4, 1, 3) (4, 3, 1) (1, 2, 5) (1, 5, 2) (2, 1, 5) (2, 5, 1) (5, 1, 2) (5,
2, 1) (1, 1, 6) (1, 6, 1) (6, 1, 1)
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

```html
Time Complexity: O(n * m * x) Space Complexity: O(n * x)
```

**Solution:-**

```python
def dice_throw(n, m, x):
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for j in range(1, min(m, x) + 1):
        dp[1][j] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, x + 1):
            for k in range(1, min(m, j) + 1):
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k]
    return dp[n][x]
```

## Optimal Binary Search Tree

**Problem:**

```html
Given a sorted array of keys, construct a height-balanced binary search tree using the keys such
that the total cost of searching all keys is minimized. The cost of searching for a key is the depth
of the key in the binary search tree. The frequency of each key is given in an array. Find the
minimum total cost of searching all keys.
```

**Example:**

```html
Input: keys = [10, 12, 20] freq = [34, 8, 50] Output: 142
```

**Explanation:**

```html
The keys are [10, 12, 20] and their corresponding frequencies are [34, 8, 50]. Our aim is to build a
binary search tree with these keys such that the cost of searching all keys is minimized. The cost
of searching a key is the total number of nodes encountered while reaching the node from the root,
including the node itself (assuming that the root level is 1). Therefore, commonly searched items
should be brought closer to the root to reduce the overall search cost.
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

```html
Time Complexity: O(n^3) Space Complexity: O(n^2)
```

**Solution**:

```python
def optimal_bst(keys, freq):
    n = len(keys)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = freq[i]
    for l in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - l + 1):
            j = i + l - 1
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i, j + 1):
                left = dp[i][k - 1] if k > i else 0
                right = dp[k + 1][j] if k < j else 0
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], left + right + sum(freq[i:j + 1]))
    return dp[0][n - 1]
```
