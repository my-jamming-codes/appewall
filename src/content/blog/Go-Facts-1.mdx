## package main

1. The `package main` is a special package in Go that tells the Go compiler that this is the **main package** for your program.
2. The `package main` is **required** for any Go program that you want to run as an executable.
3. The `package main` must contain a `func main()` function, which is the **entry point** for your Go program.
4. The `package main` is where you put the **code you want to run** when your program starts.
5. The `package main` is the **only package** that can contain the `func main()` function.

```go
// example of package main
package main

// main function
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Blank Identifier

1. The **blank identifier** is a special identifier in Go that can be used to **store values that you don’t need**.
2. It’s a way to tell Go that you **don’t care** about the value returned by a function or assigned to a variable.
3. The **blank identifier** is represented by an **underscore `_`**.
4. It’s often used when you need to **call a function that returns a value, but you don’t need that value**.
5. The **blank identifier** can also be used to **import a package solely for its side effects**.
6. This is done by importing the package with the **`_` prefix**.
7. This tells Go that you don’t need to use any of the package’s functions or variables directly, but you still want to import it for its **side effects**.
8. For example, if you want to import a package that registers itself with the `database/sql` package, you can use the **blank identifier** to import it without using any of its functions or variables.
9. This is a **common pattern** in Go for packages that need to register themselves with the standard library or other packages.

```go
// blank identifier with a function call example
_, err := fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
}

// blank identifier with a variable assignment example
_ = "Hello, World!"

// blank identifier with a package import example
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
```

## func main()

1. The **main function** is the **entry point** for your Go program.
2. When you run your Go code, the **main function** is where **execution begins**.
3. The **main function** is **required** in the `main` package.
4. The **main function** takes **no arguments** and returns **nothing**.
5. The **main function** is where you put the **code you want to run** when your program starts.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## init function

1. **init() function** is a special function in Go that is called when a package is **imported**.
2. You can use the **init() function** to perform any **initialization** that needs to be done when a package is imported.
3. The **init() function** is called **automatically** by Go when a package is imported, so you don't need to call it yourself.
4. You can have **multiple init() functions** in a package, and they will be called in the order they are declared.
5. The **init() function** is often used to set up **global variables** or perform other initialization tasks that need to be done when a package is imported.
6. The **init() function** is called **before the main function**, so any initialization that needs to be done before the main function is called can be done in the init() function.
7. The **init() function** is a good place to set up **database connections**, read configuration files, or perform other initialization tasks that need to be done before the main function is called.
8. The **init() function** is a great way to keep your code **organized** and ensure that initialization tasks are done when they need to be done.

```go

// init function example
func init() {
    fmt.Println("Initializing...")
}

// init function with multiple init functions example
func init() {
    fmt.Println("Initializing 1...")
}

func init() {
    fmt.Println("Initializing 2...")
}

// init function with database connection example
func init() {
    var err error
    db, err = sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

// init function with configuration file example
func init() {
    config, err := ioutil.ReadFile("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    err = json.Unmarshal(config, &cfg)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```
