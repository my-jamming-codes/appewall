## Personalized PageRank

1. Personalized PageRank is an extension of the classic PageRank algorithm that takes into account a user's preferences when ranking web pages.
2. The algorithm works by iteratively propagating the user's preferences through the web graph, assigning higher scores to pages that are more relevant to the user.
3. Personalized PageRank is commonly used in recommendation systems to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their browsing history or preferences.

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add edges to the graph
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)])

# Compute the Personalized PageRank
pr = nx.pagerank(G, personalization={1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0})

print(pr)
```

## ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)

1. ADMM is an optimization algorithm that is used to solve convex optimization problems with separable objective functions and constraints.
2. The algorithm works by decomposing the original problem into smaller subproblems, which are then solved iteratively using a combination of gradient descent and dual ascent.
3. ADMM is particularly useful for problems with large-scale data or high-dimensional feature spaces, as it can be parallelized and distributed across multiple processors.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

# Define the constraints
def constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 1

# Define the initial guess
x0 = np.array([0, 0])

# Solve the optimization problem using ADMM
res = minimize(objective, x0, constraints={'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint})

print(res.x)
```

## Primal-dual optimization

1. Primal-dual optimization is a class of optimization algorithms that are used to solve convex optimization problems with both primal and dual variables.
2. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the primal and dual variables to minimize the Lagrangian function, which is a combination of the objective function and the constraints.
3. Primal-dual optimization is particularly useful for problems with complex constraints or non-smooth objective functions, as it can handle a wide range of optimization problems efficiently.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

# Define the constraints
def constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 1

# Define the initial guess
x0 = np.array([0, 0])

# Solve the optimization problem using Primal-dual optimization
res = minimize(objective, x0, constraints={'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint}, method='SLSQP')

print(res.x)
```

## EVD (Eigenvalue Decomposition)

1. Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a square matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
2. The algorithm works by finding the eigenvectors of the matrix, which are the directions along which the matrix scales when multiplied by a scalar.
3. EVD is commonly used in machine learning algorithms such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and spectral clustering to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify patterns in the data.

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a random matrix
A = np.random.rand(3, 3)

# Compute the Eigenvalue Decomposition
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print(eigenvalues)
print(eigenvectors)
```

## SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, Î£, and V.
2. The algorithm works by finding the singular values of the matrix, which are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix's covariance matrix.
3. SVD is commonly used in machine learning algorithms such as matrix factorization, image compression, and collaborative filtering to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify latent features.

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a random matrix
A = np.random.rand(3, 3)

# Compute the Singular Value Decomposition
U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(A)

print(U)
print(S)
print(V)
```
