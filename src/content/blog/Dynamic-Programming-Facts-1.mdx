## Rod Cutting Problem

**Problem**: Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n.
Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

**Example**: - Input: - Length of rod: 8 - Prices: [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20] - Output: 22 - Explanation: - The maximum obtainable value is by cutting the rod into two pieces of length 2 and 6. - The price of the two pieces is 5 + 17 = 22.

**Complexity Analysis**: - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
def rod_cutting(n, prices):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], prices[j] + dp[i - j - 1])
    return dp[n]
```

## Longest Common Subsequence

**Problem**: Given a string, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

**Example**: - Input: "bbbab" - Output: 4 - Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Complexity Analysis**: - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Space Complexity: O(n^2)

```python
def longest_palindromic_subsequence(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        dp[i][i] = 1
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i + 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[0][n - 1]
```
